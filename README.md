# Online Retail Store

## Objective

The project focuses on analyzing revenue and sales data for a retail store in 2011. The analysis aims to:
- Identify seasonal revenue trends to assist the CEO in forecasting.
- Highlight top revenue-generating countries (excluding the UK) for the CMO to assess sales performance.
- Identify top 10 customers by revenue for the CMO to target high-value customers.
- Analyze demand by region (excluding the UK) to identify expansion opportunities.

## Task

In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. 

- Data cleanup 
Before you can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.

- Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
- Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0
Please note that in order to apply the checks that have been mentioned above, you would need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data from analysis. You can also use data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data. Both these methods are provided in the resources. Once this is done, the data will be good to be used for further analysis. Please note that this data should be cleaned up before attempting any question.Create each visual on a separate tab with the name of the tab displaying the question number. Once the visuals are created, save the files and upload them below. 

## Data set

Time Period: 2011

Data Cleaning Steps:

Removed rows where Quantity < 1

Ensured Unit Price >= 0

Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

Recommendations for CEO 
The CEO should focus on expansion in regions with lower sales, such as Canada, Brazil, RSA, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan, as they present significant growth opportunities. To succeed, the company should conduct market research, tailor product offerings, and invest in localized marketing and distribution networks. Building strong customer engagement strategies and monitoring performance will ensure sustainable growth in these regions.
